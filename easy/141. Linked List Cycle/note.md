Algorithm Knowledge
🧠 Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection)
This is the most popular algorithm:

Use two pointers:

slow moves one step at a time

fast moves two steps at a time

If there's a cycle, slow and fast will eventually meet

If fast or fast.next becomes null, then the list ends → no cycle

✅ Time: O(n), Space: O(1) ← required by the problem
