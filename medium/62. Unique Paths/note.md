Absolutely! Let’s break down the **Dynamic Programming (1D array)** solution to the **"Unique Paths"** problem step by step and explain how and why it works.

---

## 🧠 Problem Recap:

A robot is at the **top-left corner** of an `m x n` grid and wants to reach the **bottom-right** corner. It can only move:

- **Right** or
- **Down**

We want to compute the **number of unique paths** from start to finish.

---

## ✅ Code:

```javascript
function uniquePaths(m, n) {
  const dp = Array(n).fill(1);
  for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
      dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1];
    }
  }
  return dp[n - 1];
}
```

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Explanation:

### Step 1: Create a 1D DP array

```js
const dp = Array(n).fill(1);
```

- This array represents a **single row** of the grid.
- We initialize all values to `1` because:

  - There is only **1 way to reach any cell in the first row** (by going right all the way).

- Example: `m = 3`, `n = 4` → `dp = [1, 1, 1, 1]`

---

### Step 2: Loop through rows (starting from second row)

```js
for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
```

- We start from `i = 1` because the first row is already initialized.

---

### Step 3: Loop through columns (starting from second column)

```js
for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
  dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1];
}
```

💡 This is the key part:

- `dp[j]` = number of ways to reach cell at `(i, j)`
- We use:

  - `dp[j]` → number of ways from the **cell above**
  - `dp[j - 1]` → number of ways from the **cell to the left**

- So, total paths to `(i, j)` = `above + left`

Since we're using the same `dp` array for each row, it **builds up the values** row by row.

---

### Example Walkthrough:

Let’s say `m = 3`, `n = 4`

#### Initial dp:

```
[1, 1, 1, 1]  // first row
```

#### After processing 2nd row:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### After processing 3rd row:

```
[1, 3, 6, 10]
```

So, total unique paths = `dp[n - 1] = 10`

## 🧠 Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Value    |                                   |
| ------ | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Time   | O(m × n) |                                   |
| Space  | O(n)     | ← more efficient than 2D DP array |

---

## ✅ Summary:

- Instead of a full 2D DP grid, we use a **1D array** to store only the current row’s path counts.
- This works because each cell only depends on:

  - The value to the **left**
  - The value **above** (which is just the current value of `dp[j]` before update)
